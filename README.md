Hi, You can call me NTNU_IDIOT. This nickname means that I will be a perpetual beginner in the field of software development. I am a current full-time undergraduate senior student of Adult and Continuing Education. Besides, I am also a ***self-taught software developer***.

I am especially interested in ***statistics*** and ***machine learning***. Also, I often practice on ***LEETCODE*** to complement the foundation of data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have been allocating my time to improve my skills ***backend development and database***.

In the future, I envision myself becoming a ***backend software engineer, data analyst, or even a data scientist***. I am also ***looking for a relevant internship or job opportunity*** to strengthen my skills. If you do have something to share with me, please get in touch with me via ***GitHub***.
